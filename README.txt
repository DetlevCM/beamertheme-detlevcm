Readme v1.02 - 7th Dec 2015

The Beamer Theme DetlevCM was originally designed to be used for presentations 
at the University of Leeds (during my PhD time) - however it is NOT endorsed in 
any way by the university. (Hence being named after me.)

A sample/example presentation is included with this package.
- A table of contents is shown on slides (or blank bar without sections)
- A titlebar is optional on every slide
- Author's initials are shown on slides
- The title is shown on the slides
- The slide number is shown on the slide


To my best knowledge, it is possible to use other colour themes without any 
problems using the \usecolortheme{} command from Beamer.
